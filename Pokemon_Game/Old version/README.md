#About
System now uses ncurses and player is moveable, the menus also work as specified by 1.05. the entering into new maps is broken, I spent a long time troubleshooting but wasn't able to find the cause. trainers are colored using ncurses. a lot of things had to be reworked for ncurses to work. pressing 't' and '>' also work.
